= ensuite-present

_ensuite-present_ is part of the *ensuite* presentation toolkit dedicated to speakers and trainers.

== Overview

_ensuite-present_ is a local web app that allows the presenter to control and cast an HTML slide deck.
It provides a dual screen setup using two browser windows, one for the presentation console that the instructor sees and one for the projector view that the class sees.

A screenshot of the presentation console is shown below.
The left-hand pane of the presentation console shows the current and next slide.
The right-hand pane shows the speaker notes, with the notes for the current slide highlighted.

The projector window shows the current slide fit to the browser window.
It automatically synchronizes with the selected slide in the console when the presenter navigates between slides.

=== Notes

The notes you see on the left are provided by the slide deck.
For now, it only works with a custom plugin enabled in Bespoke presentations.
But there's nothing limiting this feature from working with other presentation software.
The notes are extracted from the HTML slides by a slide deck plugin and transmitted to _ensuite-present_ through a protocol.

This protocol and plugin are still a Work In Progress, so specifications, documentation, and other details aren't yet available.

== Prerequisite

You need https://nodejs.org[Node] 7.4.0 (and npm){blank}footnoteref:[nvm,We strongly recommend using https://github.com/creationix/nvm[nvm] to manage Node.] in order to install and run _ensuite-present_.

 $ nvm install stable

If you've already install the stable version of node using nvm, make sure to switch to it:

 $ nvm use stable

== Installation

_ensuite-present_ provides a CLI tool named `enprez` that we recommend you install globally using npm.

 $ npm install -g ensuite-present

== Usage

First, make sure your presentation is available via a URL.
If you're viewing a Bespoke presentation locally, that usually entails running `gulp serve` from the presentation directory.
Open a second terminal window to run _ensuite-present_.

To run _ensuite-present_, simply run the command:

 $ enprez

You can now visit the presentation console and projector viewport at the following URLs:

Projector view::
\http://localhost:4320/pages/viewer/

Presenter console::
\http://localhost:4320/pages/console/?slide-deck-url=<slide-deck-url>

NOTE: Customize the `slide-deck-url` parameter in the query string to match the URL of the slide deck you want to control.
